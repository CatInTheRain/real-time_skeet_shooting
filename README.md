# Real-Time Skeet Shooting
Implementation of a real time application in the C language under the Linux operating system, of a skeet shooting simulation. An alternative mode involves the simulation of an automatic system that can hit the center of the skeet in different situations, with a tunable PID controller. (C, pthread and allegro libraries)
